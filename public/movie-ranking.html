<h3>1. The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h3>
<p>Directed by Frank Darabont, this film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the                    murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the years, he forms a friendship with fellow inmate Red and finds ways to cope with the harsh realities of prison life.</p> 

<h3>2. 12 Angry Men (1957)</h3>
<p>Directed by Sidney Lumet, this classic courtroom drama revolves around twelve jurors tasked with deciding the fate of a teenage boy accused of murdering his father. What begins as an open-and-shut case gradually transforms into a tense moral debate, as one juror—played by Henry Fonda—challenges the others to reconsider their assumptions and biases. Set almost entirely within the confines of a jury room, the film masterfully explores themes of justice, prejudice, and the power of reasonable doubt, showcasing how a single voice of conscience can influence many.</p>

<h3>3. Interstellar (2014)</h3>
<p>Directed by Christopher Nolan, this epic science-fiction drama follows Cooper, a former NASA pilot turned farmer, who embarks on a daring mission through a wormhole in search of a new habitable planet as Earth faces environmental collapse. Leaving behind his daughter Murph, he joins a team of astronauts determined to secure humanity’s future among the stars. Blending emotional depth with mind-bending scientific concepts like time dilation and black holes, the film explores themes of love, sacrifice, and survival. With breathtaking visuals, a haunting score by Hans Zimmer, and a powerful narrative, Interstellar captures both the vastness of space and the enduring strength of human connection.</p>
